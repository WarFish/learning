Task #1: The Employee and ProductionWorker classes.

Write an Employee class that contains the following data attributes:
  - the name of the employee;
  - employee number.
Then write a ProductionWorker class, which is a subclass of the Employee class. The
ProductionWorker class must contain the following data attributes:
  - shift number (an integer, for example, 1 or 2);
  - hourly wage rate.
The working day is divided into two shifts: day and evening. The shift attribute will contain an
integer value representing the shift the employee is working on. Day shift is shift 1, the
evening shift is shift 2. Write appropriate getter methods and mutator methods for each class.
Then write a program that creates an object of the ProductionWorker class and asks the user to
enter data for each data attribute of this object. Store the data in an object and use getter
methods on that object to get that data and display it on the screen.
